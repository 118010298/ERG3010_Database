# ERG3010_Database
Course Project for Database and Knowledge management
The project required us to build an SQL database and query system for the Structure Inventory and Appraisal of the Nation's Bridge, an original digital record sheet available on the website of the U.S. Department of Transportation. As a master table, the sheet recorded 116 attributes of all Bridges and similar structures in each state from 1940 to 2019 with more than 720000 entries.
The first challenge of this project was to degrade the master table to several 4-dimensional tables. To achieve it, we should identify primary keys for the general table based on the inner logic between the attributes. We extract the attribute of time from the total table and divide the original table into static data and historical data. For static data, we build a two-layer tree structure based on the subordinate relationship between road and bridge. For historical data, we associate historical data with corresponding keys in static data respectively according to whether it was related to bridge inspection or traffic. The Entity-Relationship diagram of the database is shown below.
The second challenge was to describe how these attributes affect the total annual net expenditure required to repair the bridge. We first calculated Pearson Correlation Coefficient to select attributes with the most impact on the outcomes. Then, we introduced general linear regression models to finally address the problem.
